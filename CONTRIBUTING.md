## Request new features or report bugs

If you notice unexpected behavior or a limitation in FPGObservationalModel, follow the steps below before
requesting a new feature or reporting a bug.

1.  First, review the FPGObservationalModel
    [documentation](https://github.com/EMOD-Hub/FPGObservationalModel/blob/genmoz_metrics/README.md)
	to see if there is already functionality that supports what you want to do. 
2.  Search the existing [issues](https://github.com/EMOD-Hub/issues-and-discussions/issues)
    to see if there is already one that contains your feedback. If there is,
	**add a thumbs up reaction** to convey your interest in the issue being addressed. This helps the
    team gauge interest without the noise of comments, which trigger notifications to all watchers.
    Comments should be used only if you have new and useful information to share.


### Open a feature request

When opening an issue to request a new feature, do the following:

1.  Provide a clear and descriptive title for the issue.
2.  Include as many details as possible in the body. Fully explain your use case, the problems you're hitting, and the
    solutions you'd like to see to address those problems.

### Report a bug

When opening an issue to report a bug, explain the problem and include additional details to help
us reproduce the problem:

1.  Describe the specific steps that led to the problem you encountered with as many details as possible.
    Don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
2.  Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps, such as links to files or projects, code snippets,
    or screen shots. Please use Markdown code blocks for code snippets.
3.  Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out exactly what the problem
    with that behavior is, including explaining what you expected to see instead and why.


## Submit a pull request

To contribute directly to FPGObservationalModel code, do the following:

1.  Fork and clone the FPGObservationalModel repository.
2.  Install FPGObservationalModel on your machine. See the [project README](https://github.com/EMOD-Hub/FPGObservationalModel/blob/genmoz_metrics/README.md).
3.  Create a new branch::

        git checkout -b my-branch-name

4.  Make your code changes, including a descriptive commit message.
5.  Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

Although we make no guarantees that a submitted pull request will be accepted, PRs
that meet the following criteria are more likely to be merged:

*   Up-to-date with main with no merge conflicts
*   Self-contained
*   Fix a demonstrable limitation or bug
*   Follow the current code style
*   If the PR introduces a new feature, it has complete
    [Google style docstrings](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html)
	and comments, and a test demonstrating its functionality
*   Otherwise, sample code demonstrating old and new behavior (this can be in the PR comment on
    GitHub, not necessarily committed in the repo)
