# Welcome to FPGObservationalModel

This repository contains scripts for EMOD's Full Parasite Genetics output to convert modeled results into 
recapitulative sampling for genomic surveillance. The observational model options allow for curated population 
sampling and then calculated genetic metrics for user specified combinations of samples, and optionally within 
epidemioligcally relevant nested populations within a group of samples. More options in sampling and metrics can be 
edited or expanded to match empirical data analyses.
